I haven’t touched this site in a while. Then I realized: do I need a reason? Nope. So here’s a post full of random thoughts.

I ran `npx @astrojs/upgrade` and nothing broke, which is lovely. Still happy I picked Astro, working with markdown is easy, the site is fast, and big companies keep adopting it. Nice bonus.

I’m also nearing the end of my study, currently doing an internship at <s>redacted</s>, and exams are coming up. The AI stuff is weird though. ChatGPT launched right when I started learning to code. It’s useful for docs or brainstorming, but when people let it _solve_ everything, they stop actually learning (This includes myself). The moment problems get tricky, AI faceplants. I’ve already seen projects in class that scream “ChatGPT wrote me,” and I worry some folks won’t pass when they need to explain their own code. If you’re a future student reading this: let AI support your thinking, not replace it.

One thing I wish school covered more: the real fundamentals. We hopped from Scratch to HTML/CSS/JS/PHP/C#, but never something low-level like C. Even if I never use it, everything else is built on top of that stuff. If I could change the program, I’d spend a year on C + core concepts + some Python, then move into web/app/game dev, plus proper guidance on how to use AI tooling for studying since it’s not going away.

Random setup update: writing this on my ThinkPad T480, now running Debian 13. For my desktop PC I’ve been torn between Windows (games) and Linux (everything else), and a classmate reminded me dual-booting exists. So yeah… I’ll just do that: Windows + Debian.

I keep wanting to redesign this site to be _even simpler_, but honestly, not touching it is the simplest option.

Those were the random ramblings. Did anyone read this? Who knows. I just wanted to write :p
