I’ve decided to remove the work section from this website and instead create a separate project called **astro-resume**, which you can find linked in the header.

The main reason for this change is that I wasn’t happy with how I originally implemented the work content. I also had some free time and wanted to build something simple with Astro again.

The resume isn’t done (it requires some more polish IMO), but it’s good enough to share online.

This project doesn’t have an official license, but you can treat it as MIT. That said, there are probably cleaner codebases out there if you’re looking for inspiration.

I’ve also been considering rebuilding this site once Astro 6 is released, in case there are major breaking changes that need to be addressed. For now, though, the site does everything I want it to.
